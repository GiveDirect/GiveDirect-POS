/**
 * Provides base fragment dependencies. This must be included in all child fragment modules, which
 * must provide a concrete implementation of the child {@link android.support.v4.app.Fragment} and named
 * {@link #CHILD_FRAGMENT}.
 * <p>
 * Note that a different {@link javax.inject.Named} for the {@link android.support.v4.app.Fragment} is required in order to
 * remove any ambiguity about which fragment is being provided in a child fragment. For example,
 * we have parent fragment P and child fragment C. Parent fragment P will provide the Fragment
 * reference using the {@link BaseFragmentModule#FRAGMENT} name. Child fragment C will provide the
 * Fragment reference using the {@link #CHILD_FRAGMENT} name.
 * <p>
 * If the parent and child fragments are not uniquely named, then the child fragment and its
 * dependencies will not know which Fragment is provided to it. It could be the parent fragment
 * or the child fragment. Hence the ambiguity, which causes a compile error of
 * "android.app.Fragment is bound multiple times".
